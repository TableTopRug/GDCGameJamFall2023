### Branch Naming
Unity is always on some BS with it's meta files. This is especially important in the scenes, where stuff gets perma borken sometimes.
In the interest of not braking things, I propose branches are nemes as follows:

	[SceneName]-[IssueName]

You can use the default name for teh branch so long as you add the Scene name first.<br/>
Example:<br/>
&emsp;For an issue 0 with the name Example MainMenu Issue the branch would be:<br/>
&emsp;&emsp;"MainMenu-0-example-mainmenu-issue"
